Ciscomani voted for The Big Ugly Bill, and we're not letting that go.\n<p>\n\nWe have the opportunity to raise our voices to elected officials who are home this month during the Congressional recess. Let's show Rep. Ciscomani how deeply unpopular it is to vote to slash clean energy, increase pollution, intensify extreme weather, harm community health, and raise his constituents' utility bills!\n<p>\n\nOn Thursday, August 28th, we will gather as a community in front of Rep. Ciscomani's district office. As the workday wraps up, we will express our outrage, peacefully, to departing office staff and to commuters passing by.\n<p>\n\nAdditional guidance and suggestions for making your signs will be provided after registration!\n<p>\n\nSupporters at this event are for a peaceful and respectful show of support for those causes that further our mission. In the unlikely event that any participants choose to engage in violence or civil disobedience, we ask supporters to remove themselves from the vicinity of the event. In addition, please do not resist crowd control efforts by law enforcement, even if those efforts appear to be political and inappropriate.\n<p>\n\nThe event will start at 9 am to avoid the heat of the day.",

We‚Äôll have water and shade on site; please prepare for the heat (i.e., wear hats and sunscreen). Musical instruments and signs are welcome.\n<p>\n\nGuardrails: This feeder march is an independent community action and is not sponsored, endorsed, or staffed by unions. We‚Äôre timing our arrival to coincide respectfully with the picnic program.\n<p>\n\nPartners / supporters: With support from community allies including Worker Power, UNITE HERE Local 11, Lamplighters, Working Families Power, Honest Arizona, and Care in Action.\n<p>\n\nIdeas for a signs/slogans: ‚ÄúLabor Solidarity‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúProud Union Supporter‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWorkers Over Billionaires‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI Support Collective Bargaining‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúYes to Unions‚Äù\n<p>\n\nAccessibility: Easy, unhurried pace.
