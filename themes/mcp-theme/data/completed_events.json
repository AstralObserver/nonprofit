Express your opposition to Project Blue by gathering in the tree shaded area directly North of the main entrance to Tucson City Hall (along Alameda Street) on Tuesday, August 5th at 8 AM. \n<p>\n\nYour views are welcome; a bullhorn will be provided. Bring signs for display toward the building and along the street. Please bring whatever you need for the weather: drinking water, hats, snacks, etc. – and who knows, maybe umbrellas! \n<p>\nThree Facts about \"Project Blue\" \nThe operator of the proposed Data Center has remained secret - Local Lawmakers signed an NDA, with a promise not to reveal the owner/operator to their constituents. \nProject Blue would require about 6 percent of Tucson's total reclaimed water capacity. The Data Center will use ground water for the first two years. \n\"Project Blue\" AI Data Center will become TEP's largest customer. \n<p>\n\nPark in nearby public garages. Bring your passion; leave weapons at home.",

As critical jobs and services at the VA hang in the balance, his silence is unacceptable.\n<p>\n\nDespite repeated phone calls, rallies, and town halls, Rep. Ciscomani continues to ignore our concerns and instead aligns himself with Trump’s harmful agenda to dismantle the working class. His refusal to speak out or stand up for veterans is a betrayal to those who served.\n<p>\n\nJoin us on August 8th at the Tucson VA to make our voices heard.
