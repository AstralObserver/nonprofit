add placeholder tabs for the things we plan to add in the future? To reduce questions about why we don't have x or y on the website, the main things being org directory and resources/trainings

Ok, right now we can only handle 1 organizer, We would like to handle N-organizers. Don't worry about the website right now. On the GUI I wuld like a new tab that has organizers for an event. We will then need to write out n-json strucutres for each ourganizer on an event to the events.JSON
